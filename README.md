# AWS_CloudFormation
A simple CloudFormation repository to show how to create and deploy s3 and lambda templates in stack.

## Deploying Templates To CloudFormation Stacks
A CloudFormation template is a declaration of AWS resources that make up a stack. The template is stored as either a JSON or YAML file, since they are just text files they can be edited using any text editor and managed in source control system with the rest of your code.

### Template1: S3 Bucket
This template is for a simple s3 bucket. The template will be uploaded to a s3 bucket befor deploying to stack. The code to upload the template to s3 bucket is:
```sh
aws s3 cp templates/template1-s3-bucket.yaml s3://<bucket-name>/templates/template1-s3-bucket.yaml
```
Once the template has been uploaded to S3, the CloudFormation stack can be created with this code:
```sh
aws cloudformation create-stack \
--stack-name <cf-stack-name> \
--template-url https://<bucket-name>.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/templates/template1-s3-bucket.yaml \
--region eu-west-2
```
The template can be extended by adding another S3 bucket, uploading the revision to S3 and run then using the aws cloudformation update-stack command to update the stack.

### Template2: Lambda Function

### Template3: Lambda Function with S3 Trigger

### Template4: Lambda Deployment Packages
